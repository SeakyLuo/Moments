People use this app to share and rate posts.

Who is your audience?

Any people who want to share things and receive high ratings.

like you propose to be done with your app, and how your solution will
improve things for your audience.‚Äù


We provide a platform that gives everyone the power to publicly or
privately create, rate and share ideas and information, instantly, without
barriers . Users can also create a group to share the posts, which are visible

Post and ratings can be done either publicly under a name or
anonymously. Additionally, users can comment on posts or spread/retweet
them. Posts can contain text, pictures, videos and geographic locations.
The functionalities of draft box, friends, hashtag, @ and a more complete
user profile will be implemented in the future.
